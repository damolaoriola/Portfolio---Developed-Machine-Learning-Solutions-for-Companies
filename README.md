This repository contains my machine learning implementations developed for companies through competitions.


# 1) Zindi Solar Fontier Capital Solution:
   Problem Overview- Solar Frontier Capital (SFC) a pay as you go solar solutions provider, operates a system where users take on a solar contract and purchase tokens to have    
   access to solar energy depending on their needs, the amount of tokens determine the solar units available. In order to properly plan their business and optimize revenues, SFC 
   requires a machine learning solution for forecasting expected payements(variable payments are made depending on the user needs) by users in the next 6 months given historical 
   payment statistics and metadata about users.
   My solution approach:

   1st notebook: SFC Complete Analysis + Loan Status and Payment Amounts Data Preparation Notebook- Data analysis and preparation for predicting loan status and actual payment     
   amounts.
   
   2nd notebook: SFC Loan Status Modelling- Predicting a loan status indicating the loan status in the next 6 months.
   
   3rd notebook: SFC SOLAR Payment Amounts Modelling Final Solution- Predicting expected customer payments for the next 6 months
   
   
# 2 Zindi AI-4D Yoruba Machine Translation System:

   3rd place solution- Deep learning MT5 Tranformer Model for translating Yoruba sentences to English sentences. Developed for AI4D-Africa; Artificial Intelligence for  
   Development-Africa Network.

   This is a natural language MT5 trained deep learning model using simple transformers implemented with hugging face package to translate sentences from Yorùbá language to English    language in several domains like news articles, daily conversations, spoken dialog transcripts and books for AI4D-Africa. The model was trained using Google Colab Pro and takes    4 hours for training. This developed model finsihed 3rd posiition overall.
