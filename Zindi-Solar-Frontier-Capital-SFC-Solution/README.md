# Zindi-Solar-Frontier-Capital-SFC-Solution(2ND PLACE UNOFFICIAL SOLUTION)

### Problem Overview- Solar Frontier Capital (SFC) a pay as you go solar solutions provider, operates a system where users take on a solar contract and purchase tokens to have access to solar energy depending on their needs, the amount of tokens determine the solar units available. In order to properly plan their business and optimize revenues, SFC requires a machine learning solution for forecasting expected payements(variable payments are made depending on the user needs) by users in the next 6 months given historical payment statistics and metadata about users.

My solution approach:

1st notebook: SFC Complete Analysis + Loan Status and Payment Amounts Data Preparation Notebook- Data analysis and preparation for predicting loan status and actual payment amounts.

2nd notebook: SFC Loan Status Modelling- Predicting a loan status indicating the loan status in the next 6 months.

3rd notebook: SFC SOLAR Payment Amounts Modelling Final Solution- Predicting expected customer payments for the next 6 months
